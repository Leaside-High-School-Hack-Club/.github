# Leaside Hack Club

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the **Leaside Hack Club**! ðŸŽ‰

We are a student-led club at Leaside, dedicated to promoting programming, hardware projects, and open-source development. Our mission is to create a welcoming community for students who are passionate about technology, whether you're just starting out or already an experienced developer.

## About Us

Founded in 2024, the Leaside Hack Club was started to fill a gap for students interested in programming and hardware. We aim to ignite creativity and empower students to learn, collaborate, and build amazing projects together. Our club is a non-profit organization, with all donations and sponsorships going towards hardware for student projects and learning activities.

## What We Do

Our activities include:
- **Workshops:** Learn about programming, electronics, and more through hands-on tutorials.
- **Competitions:** Participate in events like plane/boat-making competitions, coding challenges, and more.
- **Projects:** Work on personal and collaborative projects, from web development to hardware design.
- **Open Source:** Contribute to open-source projects and share your work with the community.
